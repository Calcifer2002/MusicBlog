    <img src= "Images/yorushika.jpg">
    <p>Yorushika is a rock duo consisting of N-buna -a former Vocaloid producer and Suis- a female vocalist. The two are extremely secretive and has never made any public appearances, or even conduct a lot of concerts either. It could be due to two reasons- their roots in Vocaloid where people work under aliases almost 100% of the time and try to stay anonymous and is kind of a thing in the Japanese indie music subculture. However, the duo stated that the reason for their secrecy is that they want their audiences to listen to their music without "preconceptions".</p><hr>
    <h3>3.Kenshi Yonezu</h3>
    <img src= "Images/kenshi-yonezu.jpg">
    <p>Kenshi Yonezu began his musical career by releasing Vocaloid music under the name Hachi on a website. They were unable to get widespread attention. During his high school days in 2006, he was the vocalist and songwriter of a band he formed with his friend called Late Rabbit Eda. In the year 2012, he finally debuted under his own name and sang songs in his own voice. His first album - Diorama debuted at No 6 and his most popular song Lemon which was inspired by a relative's death lead Billboard Charts in both Japan and the U.S for two consecutive years.</p><hr>
    <h3>4.Nulbarich</h3> 
    <img src="Images/nulbarich.jpeg">
    <p>Nulbarich is a five-piece J rock/pop group that debuted in the year 2016. The members of this band are not fixed, they change depending on the song except for one member-Jeremy Quartus. The name Nulbarich is a portmanteau of "null but rich"(being satisfied despite having nothing). Their music combines pop with rock, funk, and acid jazz. They made their debut with the single "Hometown" after which they released their debut album "Guess who". Despite being a debut album it managed to be a sleeper hit - reaching #45 on the Oricon charts for several months.</p>
